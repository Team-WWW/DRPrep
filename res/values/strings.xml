    <string name="thunderstormtxt">All thunderstorms are dangerous. Every thunderstorm produces lightning. Although most 
lightning victims survive, people struck by lightning often report a variety of long-term, debilitating symptoms.
Other associated dangers of thunderstorms include tornadoes, strong winds, hail and flash 
flooding. Dry thunderstorms that do not produce rain that reaches the ground are most prevalent 
in the western United States. Falling raindrops evaporate, but lightning can still reach the 
ground and can start wildfires.</string>
