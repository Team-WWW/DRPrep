    <string name="thunderstormtxt">\n
        \t\tAll thunderstorms are dangerous. Every thunderstorm produces lightning. 
        Although most lightning victims survive, people struck by lightning often report a variety of long-term, debilitating symptoms.\n\n
        \t\tOther associated dangers of thunderstorms include tornadoes, strong winds, hail and flash flooding. Dry thunderstorms that do not produce rain that reaches the ground are most prevalent in the western United States. 
Falling raindrops evaporate, but lightning can still reach the ground and can start wildfires.\n\n

\t\tTo prepare for a thunderstorm, you should do the following:\n\n
&#8226;\t To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm.\n\n
&#8226;\t Postpone outdoor activities.\n\n
&#8226;\t Remember the 30/30 Lightning Safety Rule: Go indoors if, after seeing lightning, you cannot count to 30 before hearing thunder. Stay indoors for 30 minutes after hearing the last clap of thunder.\n\n
&#8226;\t Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage.\n\n
&#8226;\t Get inside a home, building, or hard top automobile (not a convertible). Although you may be injured if lightning strikes your car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than outside.\n\n
&#8226;\t Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal.\n\n
&#8226;\t Shutter windows and secure outside doors. If shutters are not available, close window blinds, shades or curtains.\n\n
&#8226;\t Unplug any electronic equipment well before the storm arrives.\n\n

<string name="wildfiretxt">\n
\t\t Wildfires often begin unnoticed. These fires are usually triggered by lightning or accidents. They spread quickly, igniting brush, trees, and homes. Reduce your risk by preparing now - before wildfire strikes. Meet with your family to decide what to do and where to go if wildfires threaten your area. Follow the steps listed below to protect your family, home, and property\n\n

\t\t The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property in the event of a fire.\n\n
&#8226;\t To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Use fire-resistant or noncombustible materials on the roof and exterior structure of the dwelling, or treat wood or combustible material used in roofs, siding, decking or trim with fire-retardant chemicals evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory, such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL).\n\n
&#8226;\t Plant fire-resistant shrubs and trees. For example, hardwood trees are less flammable than pine, evergreen, eucalyptus or fir trees.\n\n
&#8226;\t Regularly clean roof and gutters.\n\n
&#8226;\t Inspect chimneys at least twice a year. Clean them at least once a year. Keep the dampers in good working order. Equip chimneys and stovepipes with a spark arrester that meets the requirements of National Fire Protection Association Standard 211. (Contact your local fire department for exact specifications.)\n\n
&#8226;\t Install a dual-sensor smoke alarm on each level of your home, especially near bedrooms; test monthly and change the batteries at least once each year.\n\n
&#8226;\t Teach each family member how to use a fire extinguisher (ABC type) and show them where it\'s kept.\n\n
&#8226;\t Keep a ladder that will reach the roof.\n\n
&#8226;\t Consider installing protective shutters or heavy fire-resistant drapes.\n\n
&#8226;\t Clear items that will burn from around the house, including wood piles, lawn furniture, barbecue grills, tarp coverings, etc. Move them outside of your defensible space.\n\n

\t\t Your best resource for proper planning is www.firewise.org which has outstanding information used daily by residents, property owners, fire departments, community planners, builders, public policy officials, water authorities, architects and others to assure safety from fire - it really works. Firewise workshops are offered for free all across the nation in communities large and small and free Firewise materials can be obtained easily by anyone interested.\n\n

<string name="earthquaketxt">\n
\t\t One of the most frightening and destructive phenomena of nature is a severe earthquake and its terrible after effects. An earthquake is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the breaking and shifting of subterranean rock as it releases strain that has accumulated over a long time. All 50 states and 5 U.S. territories are at some risk for earthquakes.  Earthquakes can happen at any time of the year. It is impossible to predict when or where an earthquake will occur, so it is important that you and your family are prepared ahead of time.\n\n
\t\tThe following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property in the event of an earthquake.\n\n

&#8226;\t To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Fasten shelves securely to walls.\n\n
&#8226;\t Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves.\n\n
&#8226;\t Store breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.\n\n
&#8226;\t Fasten heavy items such as pictures and mirrors securely to walls and away from beds, couches and anywhere people sit.\n\n
&#8226;\t Brace overhead light fixtures and top heavy objects.\n\n
&#8226;\t Repair defective electrical wiring and leaky gas connections. These are potential fire risks. Get appropriate professional help. Do not work with gas or electrical lines yourself.\n\n
&#8226;\t Install flexible pipe fittings to avoid gas or water leaks. Flexible fittings are more resistant to breakage.\n\n
&#8226;\t Secure your water heater, refrigerator, furnace and gas appliances by strapping them to the wall studs and bolting to the floor. If recommended by your gas company, have an automatic gas shut-off valve installed that is triggered by strong vibrations.\n\n
&#8226;\t Store weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products securely in closed cabinets with latches and on bottom shelves.\n\n
&#8226;\t Locate safe spots in each room under a sturdy table or against an inside wall. Reinforce this information by moving to these places during each drill.\n\n
&#8226;\t Hold earthquake drills with your family members: Drop, cover and hold on.\n\n

        \t\tFloods are one of the most common hazards in the United States, however not all floods are alike. Some floods develop slowly, while others such a flash floods, can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\n\n

&#8226;\t To prepare for a flood, you should:\n\n
&#8226;\t Build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home.\n\n
&#8226;\t Elevate the furnace, water heater and electric panel in your home if you live in an area that has a high flood risk.\n\n
&#8226;\t Consider installing "check valves" to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.\n\n
&#8226;\t If feasible, construct barriers to stop floodwater from entering the building and seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds.\n\n

<string name="hurricanetxt">\n
\t\t A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone or severe tropical storm that forms in southern oceans. A typical cyclone is accompanied by thunderstorms, and in the Northern Hemisphere, a counterclockwise circulation of winds near the earth’s surface.\n\n
\t\t The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June to November, with the peak season from mid-August to late October. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15 and ends November 30.\n\n
\t\t Hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to coastlines and several hundred miles inland. Hurricane can produce winds exceeding 155 miles per hour as well as tornadoes.. Additionally, hurricanes can create storm surges along the coast and cause extensive damage from heavy rainfall. Floods and flying debris from the excessive winds are often the deadly and destructive results of these weather events. Slow moving hurricanes traveling into mountainous regions tend to produce especially heavy rain.\n\n
\t\t To prepare for a hurricane, you should take the following measures:\n\n
&#8226;\t To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Know your surroundings.\n\n
&#8226;\t Learn the elevation level of your property and whether the land is flood-prone. This will help you know how your property will be affected when storm surge or tidal flooding are forecasted.\n\n
&#8226;\t Identify levees and dams in your area and determine whether they pose a hazard to you.\n\n
&#8226;\t Learn community hurricane evacuation routes and how to find higher ground. Determine where you would go and how you would get there if you needed to evacuate.\n\n
Make plans to secure your property:\n\n
&#8226;\t Cover all of your home’s windows.\n\n
&#8226;\t Install straps or additional clips to securely fasten your roof to the frame structure. This will reduce roof damage.\n\n
&#8226;\t Be sure trees and shrubs around your home are well trimmed so they are more wind resistant.\n\n
&#8226;\t Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts.\n\n
&#8226;\t Reinforce your garage doors; if wind enters a garage it can cause dangerous and expensive structural damage.\n\n
&#8226;\t Plan to bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations, garbage cans and anything else that is not tied down.\n\n
&#8226;\t If in a high-rise building, be prepared to take shelter on or below the 10th floor.\n\n

\t\t Hurricanes cause heavy rains that can cause extensive flood damage in coastal and inland areas. Everyone is at risk and should consider flood insurance protection. Flood insurance is the only way to financially protect your property or business from flood damage. To learn more about your flooding risk and how to protect yourself and your business, visit the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (NFIP) Web site,www.floodsmart.gov or call 1-800-427-2419.\n\n

    <string name="tornadotxt">\n
\t\t Spawned from powerful thunderstorms, tornadoes can cause fatalities and devastate a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Some tornadoes are clearly visible, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds obscure others. Occasionally, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the wind may die down and the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel is not visible. Tornadoes generally occur near the trailing edge of a thunderstorm. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado.\n\n

&#8226;\t To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or to commercial radio or television newscasts for the latest information. In any emergency, always listen to the instructions given by local emergency management officials.\n\n
&#8226;\t Be alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.\n\n
&#8226;\t Look for the following danger signs:\n\n
\t\t\t&#8226;\t Dark, often greenish sky\n\n
\t\t\t&#8226;\t Large hail\n\n
\t\t\t&#8226;\t A large, dark, low-lying cloud\n\n
\t\t\t&#8226;\t Loud roar, similar to a freight train.\n\n
If you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.\n\n

    <string name="heatwavetxt">\n
\t\tHeat kills by pushing the human body beyond its limits. In extreme heat and high humidity, evaporation is slowed and the body must work extra hard to maintain a normal temperature.\n\n

To prepare for extreme heat, you should:\n\n
&#8226;\t Build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.\n\n
&#8226;\t Install window air conditioners snugly; insulate if necessary.\n\n
&#8226;\t Check air-conditioning ducts for proper insulation.\n\n
&#8226;\t Install temporary window reflectors (for use between windows and drapes), such as aluminum foil-covered cardboard, to reflect heat back outside.\n\n
&#8226;\t Weather-strip doors and sills to keep cool air in.\n\n
&#8226;\t Cover windows that receive morning or afternoon sun with drapes, shades, awnings, or louvers. (Outdoor awnings or louvers can reduce the heat that enters a home by up to 80 percent.)\n\n
&#8226;\t Keep storm windows up all year.\n\n
&#8226;\t Listen to local weather forecasts and stay aware of upcoming temperature changes.\n\n
&#8226;\t Be aware that people living in urban areas may be at greater risk from the effects of a prolonged heat wave than are people living in rural areas.\n\n
&#8226;\t Get trained in first aid to learn how to treat heat-related emergencies.\n\n
